/**
 * @mainpage Introduction & Library overview

 * The library is at the moment at a very early stage (alpha), but it is functional. The idea behind it is to simplify using Atmega328p peripherals, 
 * by creating a set of simple routines in order to configure and use it quickly. At the moment it has been tested and developed mostly on Arduino UNO rev 3 board, and 
 * for the time being is dedicated to this hardware.The library is written completely in C and is dedicated to speed up everyday C coding for Arduino platform without
 * having a need to use the Arduino Library, which for the cost of simplifying development process (which is good), separates the user from the hardware quite mostly 
 * (which isn't that good). 
 * 
 * @section features Features
 *
 * For the moment the following functionalities are implemented and tested:
 *
 * 
 * - Timer Delays (Arduino Library sleep/millis equivalent)
 * - Timer PWM support
 * - Beeper - Tone generation (Arduino Library tone equiv.)
 * - Serial port support - Interrupt driven data reception, data reception by polling, data transmission by polling
 * - SLIP protocol - serial line data synchronization protocol, to support binary data transfers over serial line
 * - Simple ADC API
 * - Simple GPIO abstraction layer
 * - Software OneWire 
 * - I2C 
 * - SPI
 *  
 * The library implements basic device drivers for the following devices:
 * - general 7 segment display driver - driver for LED 7 segment display, implementing interrupt driven multiplexing
 * - ds1307 - an interface for the RTC clock to map it's internal registers
 * - ds18b20 - Digital Temperature sensor, the driver is heavilly dependant on the software onewire implementation
 * - hd44780 - hitachi display driver
 * - pcd8544 - display driver for the NOKIA 3310 based LCDs
 * 
 *
 * @section usage Using the documentation
 *
 * For details regarding particular functionality please refer directly to a specific interface file.
 *
 * @section examples Examples
 * Please refer to the provided examples as well for an overview on how to use a particular module.
 *
 * @section support Support
 *
 * If you are unsure about the something you can also refer to my blog (http://pcarduino.blogspot.co.uk) dedicated to
 * development in C for arduino platform, where I heavily use this library. You can also contact me through github.com/dagon666
 *
 * @section compilation Compiling with your own project
 *
 * It is very simple to use this library with your own project. You can customize the config.h settings, pre-build it and then just simply link your project against
 *  the static library. Or you can include it as a compilation target in your Makefile. Below is an example Makefile for a simple project haing only one file: main.c.
 *  The following directory structure has been assumed:
 *
 * @verbatim
 *  .
 *  | -- project
 *  | ---- Makefile
 *  | ---- main.c
 *  | -- pca
 *  | ---- ...
 *
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * @code
